# Linux-MIA
Resources for Linux users who follow the Mass Immersion Approach.

As the tools developed by the MIA team aren't officially supported on Linux platforms, so I have decided to provide some aid based on my own experience.

I encourage you to read the wiki I prepared with basic information necessary to use the files provided in this repo.

This is aimed at beginners, but if you're an advanced user, you may still find some information useful.
