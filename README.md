# Linux-MIA
Resources for Linux users who follow the Mass Immersion Approach.

This repository provides files and instructions to replicate [a typical workflow
when mining cards](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfvDKgNUSi8) in a Linux
system.

Using simple command line tool like `xclip`, `imagemagick`, `arecord` and
`ffmpeg`, it's possible to make scripts with dependencies that most users
should naturally fulfill. Each user is free to use and modify the scripts as
he/she sees fit.

The folder structure is the following:

    * AUDIO - how to record playback audio and export to Anki
        *  .asoundrc - config file for ALSA
        *  qolibri-play - script for grabbing audio from qolibri
        *  record - script for recording playback audio
    * PICTURE - how to quickly take screenshots and export them to Anki

I encourage you to read the [wiki](https://github.com/edulim/Linux-MIA/wiki) 
prepared with basic information necessary to use the files provided in this
repo.
